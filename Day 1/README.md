# Day 1: MLOps / LLMOps Foundation â€“ Bootcamp

Welcome to **Day 1** of the MLOps/LLMOps Bootcamp! This repository contains a set of **hands-on exercises** that introduce core concepts and tools for machine learning operations. You'll work with tools like **Git**, **MLflow**, **Docker**, and **CI/CD pipelines**, building real workflows from development to deployment.

---

## Repository Structure Overview

### 1. `lesson-2-git/` â€“ Version Control with Git

Implement a simple **Random Forest model** on the **Iris dataset** and learn how to use **Git** for version control to track code changes.

ðŸ”— See [lesson-2-git/README.md](lesson-2-git/README.md) for details and instructions.

---

### 2. `lesson-3-mlflow/` â€“ Experiment Tracking with MLflow

Track and manage a **Logistic Regression model** for **air quality classification** using **MLflow Tracking UI**. Learn to log parameters, metrics, and model versions.

ðŸ”— See [lesson-3-mlflow/README.md](lesson-3-mlflow/README.md) for details and setup.

---

### 3. `lesson-4-docker/` â€“ Model Deployment with Docker

Build and deploy an **Age Detection model** using **Flask** and containerize it using **Docker**. Learn to run ML models as APIs in isolated environments.

ðŸ”— See [lesson-4-docker/README.md](lesson-4-docker/README.md) for Docker usage and running the app.

---

### 4. `lesson-5-ml-pipeline/` â€“ ML Pipeline with MLflow & Flask

Implement a complete **machine learning pipeline** for income classification. Includes:

* Data preprocessing pipeline
* Model training with experiment tracking via MLflow
* Model deployment using Flask & Docker

ðŸ”— See [lesson-5-ml-pipeline/README.md](lesson-5-ml-pipeline/README.md) for step-by-step usage.

---

### 5. `lesson-6-ci-cd/` â€“ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Extend the ML pipeline by integrating **CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions**. Automate testing, building, and deployment of your ML API.

ðŸ”— See [lesson-6-ci-cd/README.md](lesson-6-ci-cd/README.md) for automation setup and workflow explanation.

---

##  Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed before starting the exercises:

* **Python 3.x**
* **Git**
* **Docker**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **MLflow**
* **Postman**
